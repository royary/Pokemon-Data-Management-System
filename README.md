# Project Description
# Our project focuses on developing a Pokemon data collection and game strategy management system using a relational database. The database models key aspects such as Pokemon species data, performance analysis, game mechanics, and team composition to help trainers optimize their gameplay. Users can store, retrieve, and analyze Pokemon attributes, evolution paths, and battle strategies, enhancing their decision-making in the game.
